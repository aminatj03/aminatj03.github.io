						<summary>Some Useful Tips</summary>
						<p>We’d hate for you to not receive your order. Please make sure that the shipping address is correct as we’re unable to redirect orders once they’re on their way to you.</p>

						</p>Your security is important to us, so before we can dispatch your purchase we may need you to confirm your details with your card issuer. Delays aren’t fun for anyone so we’ll do our best to make it quick.</p>

						<p>Our delivery time starts from the moment an order is accepted. This includes a 24 period where your items will be processed and dispatched by our warehouse. Please note this can take longer during our sale periods, when it may take up to 48 hours for shipments to be dispatched.</p>

						<p>We’re all about good relationships and we work closely with our shipping partner to minimise the potential impact of custom delays on our international customers.</p>

						<p>To minimise delays, we recommend using your work address as your delivery address.</p>
